TODO: Parse export.csv downloaded from:
   https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/country-data-codes/
   This one includes the most codes and is freely downloadable as a (complex) csv

Easy(?) path for today is to copy-paste from here:
  https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/
into country_codes_from_unstats.xlsx
and export as tab-delimited country_codes_from_unstats.txt
  (Because three rows have a double quoted string containing a comma
   in the CountryOrArea column, like:
     "Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba",535,BES
  )
