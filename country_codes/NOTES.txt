The Goal: Create a mapping of common English names for countries to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes.

TODO: Parse export.csv downloaded from:
   https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/country-data-codes/
   This one includes the most codes and is freely downloadable as a (complex) csv

Easy(?) path for today is to copy-paste from here:
  https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/
into country_codes_from_unstats.xlsx
and export as tab-delimited country_codes_from_unstats.txt
(Tab-delimited because one column has values with comma's.)
