Learn SQL order of execution by getting it wrong.

The good news, the order of execution mostly matches their order in your code.
But unfortunately, SELECT is totally out of place. And it was a long time before I realized that the the order of the rest made sense.

FROM, JOIN, ON
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT, DISTINCT
ORDER BY
LIMIT
